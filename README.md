My solutions to the Krittika Tutorial problems


As a part of the WiDS(Winter in Data Science) project in Data=Driven Astronomy at IIT Bombay, I have solved these tutorial problems from the Krittika resource for beginners who
want to work with astronomical data in python.

I have uploaded tutorials 1-10 except 5 and 8 due to unavailability of a .FITS file while solving. I will be uploading the remaining tutorials soon.
