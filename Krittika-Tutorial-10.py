'''
This tutorial mainly deals with the astropy module. It explains the working of units in astronomy and how the astropy module can be used to keep track of units and constants.
It tackles astronomical filters as an astrophysics topic.

Given: 

for star Arcturus, the intensities in 2 wavelength bands are given - 
intensity_G = 1.3887e-09 * (u.W / u.m**2)
intensity_R = 2.5553e-09 * (u.W / u.m**2)

Properties of the filters used to measure these values are given in file filter_curves.fits.

Task:
Estimate the temperature of Arcturus to within  ¬±50ùêæ . You may assume that Arcturus behaves like a perfect blackbody.
